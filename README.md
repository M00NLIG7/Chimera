I need a distributed node system which can connect to both windows and linux then replicate itself until every machine on the network has a node on it. We can assume winrm and ssh will both be closed on windows. How would i connect using something like psexec if I am running the starting node on linux

The name "Chimera" can be a cool name for a Purple Team malware for a few reasons:

Mythical Creature: Chimera is a mythical creature from Greek mythology that was a combination of different animals, typically a lion, goat, and serpent. The idea of combining different elements into a single entity can be reflective of the purpose of a Purple Team, which is to combine different offensive and defensive techniques to improve overall security.

Stealthy: Chimera is a stealthy creature that can blend in with its surroundings and strike unexpectedly. Similarly, a Purple Team may use malware to test the effectiveness of an organization's defenses and identify any weaknesses that may be exploited by real attackers.

Unpredictable: The Chimera was known for its unpredictability and ability to surprise its prey. This can be reflective of the behavior of a malware that is designed to evade detection and perform unexpected actions on a target system.

Unique: The name Chimera is unique and not commonly used for malware, which can make it stand out and memorable. This can be important for security researchers who need to track and analyze different types of malware.

Cross-Platform: The term "Chimera" is also used to describe a hybrid organism composed of cells from different species. This idea of a hybrid entity can reflect a malware that can work across multiple platforms, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Multi-Stage: The Chimera is also associated with multi-stage attacks, where the attacker employs a series of tactics to achieve their goals. This can be reflective of a malware that has multiple components, each designed to bypass different security measures in a target system.

Evolutionary: In biology, the term "Chimera" can also describe the process of genetic recombination, where different genetic material is combined to create a new organism. This can be reflective of a malware that evolves over time as it adapts to changes in the target environment and updates its attack tactics accordingly.

Complex: The Chimera is a complex creature that can be difficult to understand and predict. Similarly, a malware with the name Chimera can be complex and sophisticated, with multiple layers of obfuscation and advanced evasion techniques to avoid detection by security software.

Intimidating: The Chimera is a powerful and fearsome creature, which can make it a cool name for a malware that is designed to intimidate and strike fear into the hearts of potential targets.

Overall, the name Chimera can be a cool and fitting choice for a Purple Team malware that combines different offensive and defensive tactics to improve an organization's overall security posture.
